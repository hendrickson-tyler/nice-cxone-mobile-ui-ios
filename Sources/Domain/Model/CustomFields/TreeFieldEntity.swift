/// Tree field form custom field type
///
/// This class is designed for representing hierarchical tree structures within forms. 
/// The `children` property allows you to define the hierarchy of child nodes, 
/// making it suitable for capturing complex data structures.
/// It can be easily integrated into SwiftUI views for managing and displaying hierarchical data in forms.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```
/// let children = [...]
/// let treeFieldEntity = TreeFieldEntity(label: "Devices", isRequired: true, ident: "devices", children: children, value: "iPhone 14")
///
/// chatCoordinator.presentForm(title: "Tree Options", customFields: [treeFieldEntity]) {
///     ...
/// }
/// ```
public class TreeFieldEntity: FormCustomFieldType {

    // MARK: - Properties

    /// An array of `TreeNodeFieldEntity` objects, representing the children of the tree field.
    public var children: [TreeNodeFieldEntity]

    // MARK: - Init
    
    /// Initialization of the TreeFieldEntity
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - label: The label or name of the custom field.
    ///   - isRequired: A boolean indicating whether this field is required to be filled out.
    ///   - ident: A unique identifier or key for this field.
    ///   - children: An array of `TreeNodeFieldEntity` objects, representing the children of the tree field.
    ///   - value: The current value associated with the field, which can be updated and observed using the `@Published` property wrapper.
